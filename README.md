The [Cleveland PyLadies website](https://clepyladies.github.io/pyladies-official) is built on Pelican, a Python-based static site generator. To contribute content posts: fork this repo, create your post as amarkdown file in the content folder, and make a pull request. We love community contributions and happily accept pull requests from first-time contributors! Don't know where to start? Attend a meetup and we'll help you get started!

Organizer notes:

* Can we put together a video walkthrough of making a PR to this site? I'd love to have a custom YouTube resource to help familiarize newbies with the process.

* The site build is automated by Travis-CI on any merges or commits to master.

* Check to see if your fork is ## commits behind master before submitting pull requests. You can compare across forks and pull from the original repo directly on GitHub, if necessary. Note that you may lose changes if your fork is behind the site repo, so make changes in small increments.
