The [Cleveland PyLadies website](https://clepyladies.github.io/pyladies-official) is built on Pelican, a Python-based static site generator. To contribute content posts: fork this repo, create your post as amarkdown file in the content folder, and make a pull request. We love community contributions and happily accept pull requests from first-time contributors! Don't know where to start? Attend a meetup and we'll help you get started!

Organizer note:

* Can we put together a video walkthrough of making a PR to this site? I'd love to have a custom YouTube resource to help familiarize newbies with the process.
