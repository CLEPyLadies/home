Our mission statement:

Cleveland PyLadies is an open and inclusive Python user group
explicitly focused on engaging women and underrepresented populations in tech,
specifically in and around Northeast Ohio. We are a local chapter of the global
Pyladies organization.

Our commitment to remote participation:

We understand that work schedules, motherhood, transportation,
and many other factors can act as a barrier for many women
that otherwise would love to engage with local tech communities.
Because of this, we aim to stream ~30 minute chunks of our meetups
to facilitate participation of PyLadies that are not able to make
a meeting in person.

Many of our members are new to Python, so we curate playlists of educational videos and tutorials.

[PyLadies Global](http://www.pyladies.com) mission statement:

PyLadies is an international mentorship group with a focus on helping
more women become active participants and leaders in the Python open-source community.
Our mission is to promote, educate, and advance a diverse Python community through
outreach, education, conferences, and social gatherings.
PyLadies also aims to provide a friendly support network for women and
a bridge to the larger Python world. Anyone with an interest in Python is encouraged to participate!
