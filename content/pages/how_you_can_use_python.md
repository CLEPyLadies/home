Summary:  A brief overview of who uses Python and some packages they use to solve real-world problems.

Python is an extremely versatile programming language known for its beginner-friendly syntax.  It is used by NASA, Google, GenomOncology, OnShift, SkipList, Dropbox, Quora, and many others.

Python is great for scripting, the automation of short repetitive tasks.

Here are some examples of libraries people use to solve real-world problems in multiple domains with Python:

  Science with [SciPy](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/python-scipy-tutorial), [NumPy](https://www.machinelearningplus.com/python/numpy-tutorial-part1-array-python-examples/)

  Web Development with [Django](https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/series/2017/09/04/a-complete-beginners-guide-to-django-part-1.html) and [Flask](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/flask/)

  Machine Learning with [Scikit-learn](https://medium.com/@mwitiderrick/introduction-to-supervised-learning-with-python-scikit-learn-tutorial-966457dd33b9)

  Deep Learning with [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/)

  Data Visualization using [Bokeh](https://www.fullstackpython.com/blog/responsive-bar-charts-bokeh-flask-python-3.html) and [Seaborn](https://elitedatascience.com/python-seaborn-tutorial)


No matter which area interests you, pick a problem and break it down into manageable pieces.  Approach it step-by-step.  See what you can find online (Google, StackOverflow, YouTube, documentation) when you get stuck, and be sure to ask for help if you've hit an impasse.

There are many other ways to use and apply Python.  What will you build using your awesome programming skills?
