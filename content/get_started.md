# So you want to make a PR

GREAT! We love pull requests.
The easiest way to get involved is to write about your experiences with Python and PyLadies on our blog.
Here are a few steps to help you get started:

1. Decide what you will write. It may be helpful to draft it out in your word processor or text editor of choice first.

2. Fork this repo!

3. Add a .md file with your post in the 'content' folder **on branch master**. Your file needs to have a line with the title
`Title: {{ your awesome title here }}`
and may have any/all of the following metadata:

`Date: 2010-12-03 10:20

Modified: 2020-12-05 19:30

Category: Blog # PLEASE CHOOSE AN EXISTING CATEGORY - We may edit your category if it does not match our menu bar.

Tags: pelican, publishing # Choose any tags you like! Tag it up!

Slug: my-super-post # Defaults to your title, but you may set it directly.

Authors: Cleveland PyLadies, Floaty McFloatFace # Own it, lady!

Summary: Short version for index and feeds # Again all of these are optional.`

Your super content goes below your metadata block. Remember to commit changes to your fork before moving on!

4. Check to see if your fork is behind the main repo by any number of commits. These may cause problems if merge commits emerge between fork and PR.

5. Make a new pull request on the main repo by selecting `compare across forks` and setting your fork master as the head.
(Remember to click the green button when the merge is available!)

6. BOOM! You're officially an open-source contributor.
Shoot us an email or get at us on social if more than a week goes by and we haven't addressed your PR!
