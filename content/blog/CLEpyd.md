What's new with Cleveland PyLadies? Well...we're glad you asked!

# Leadership

We have recently added a new member to our leadership team: Kjera!

# Resources

## Websites

We are moving! Cleveland PyLadies web resources will soon point to the much
shorter url _[clepyd.org](http://clepyd.org)_. So much less typing!

In addition to our event calendar on [meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/CLE-PyLadies/) and this blog,
we are adding a web app (written in Django, of course) so that members can check in online.
This helps us monitor attendance, keep in touch with repeat attendees, engage with new members, and
ultimately improve the overall experience of our meetups. We are also working to add a shared
_job board_ for the Python user groups in Cleveland.

## Sponsors

We are partnering with local data consultancy _Pandata_ to provide at least one data science
specific event per quarter. They are passionate about data ethics and we are excited to have
them on board.
