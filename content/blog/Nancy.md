Summary: Learning as a senior 
Author: Nancy

I come to coding pretty late for a career change. Truly, I was getting stagnant in my other job. I wanted to challenge myself but not ready to invest financially in classes so I am trying all the free bootcamps out in cyberspace. The first language I dappled in was Javascript. Not the easiest, and not often link with statistical analysis. If I were to jump into coding as a career, I think my niche would be in data science area. Like analyzing sales or customer satisfaction or the efficacy of some drug. I found Python to be more “forgiving” and more intuitive. Also, I wanted to be on a ladies team, sounds cool to be part of Pyladies.

Here are some of the websites I checked out:
